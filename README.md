## Overview

Fraudulent activities are a significant concern in the financial sector. This project aims to build and evaluate models that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a given dataset. The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model development.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model building (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using various metrics
- Visualization of results

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rakshithraj14/Fraud_detection.git
    cd Fraud_detection
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook(s) and follow the instructions in each section to run the analysis and model training:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
